// This script file is currently empty as there are no specific JavaScript functionalities mentioned in the project description.
// However, you can add interactivity to your website using JavaScript. For example, you can create a responsive navigation menu, 
// add animations, handle form submissions, etc. 

// Here is a simple example of how you can use JavaScript to display a welcome message to the user:

window.onload = function() {
    alert("Welcome to AI in Business: A Comprehensive Guide to Boosting Productivity and Profitability!");
}
